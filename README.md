[Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md)

Meddlr is a config-driven ML framework built to simplify medical image reconstruction and analysis problems.

## ‚ö° QuickStart
```bash
# Install Meddlr with basic dependencies
pip install meddlr

# Install Meddlr with all dependencies (e.g. pretrained models, benchmarking)
pip install 'meddlr[all]'
```

> _Installing locally_: For local development, fork and clone the repo and run `pip install -e ".[alldev]"`

> _Installing from main_: For most up-to-date code without a local install, run `pip install "meddlr @ git+https://github.com/ad12/meddlr@main"`

Configure your paths and get going!
```python
import meddlr as mr
import os

# (Optional) Configure and save machine/cluster preferences.
# This only has to be done once and will persist across sessions.
cluster = mr.Cluster()
cluster.set(results_dir="/path/to/save/results", data_dir="/path/to/datasets")
cluster.save()
# OR set these as environment variables.
os.environ["MEDDLR_RESULTS_DIR"] = "/path/to/save/results"
os.environ["MEDDLR_DATASETS_DIR"] = "/path/to/datasets"
```

Detailed instructions are available in [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md).

## üêò Model Zoo
Easily serve and download pretrained models from the model zoo. A (evolving) list of pre-trained models can be found [here](MODEL_ZOO.md), on [HuggingFace ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/arjundd), and in [project folders](projects).

To use them, pass the URLs for the config and weights (model) files to `mr.get_model_from_zoo`:

```python
import meddlr as mr

model = mr.get_model_from_zoo(
  cfg_or_file="https://huggingface.co/arjundd/vortex-release/resolve/main/mridata_knee_3dfse/Supervised/config.yaml",
  weights_path="https://huggingface.co/arjundd/vortex-release/resolve/main/mridata_knee_3dfse/Supervised/model.ckpt",
)
```
